Documentation:
	- Generate docs for the API

Bugs:
	- Setting an output filename doesn't seem to work @commandline
		It still generates the name of the C++ files from the name of the language file
Refactoring:
	- Simplify/split up the language_stage class @compiler
		It current compiles the lexer and builds up an abstract representation of the grammar. We need to separate the lexer and grammar generation phases, and move the data into their own classes.

		(The existing definition of the class: that it translate the grammar/lexer for a particular language is fine but there are really too many steps for a single class to reasonably deal with)

	- Move the compiler data into separate classes @compiler
		Currently we pass the compiler classes around but this will make it difficult to maintain the compiler in the long term.

		Should probably make the stages that print out statistics separate from the stages that generate them
		- language_stage
		- import_stage
		- lexer_stage
		- parser_stage (though we already use the definition_file_container object for this purpose)

	- Be more consistent about the way that public fields are named
		Stack entry uses no 'm_' but the parse tables do, for instance
General:
	- Check that all the operator< implementations work correctly

	- Replace all usages of it or x with a more descriptive variable name

	- Write a textmate/sublime text language file for the definition language

	- Make it possible to determine if a stage reported an error on an individual stage basis
		- Use this to stop trying to run tests if the parser/lexer for a language can't be built

	- end_ast_rule needs rewriting with less confusing logic
		In fact, we really need to change the whole way that languages are generated so that new languages can be added sensibly.

	- Ensure that the errors format matches that of gcc
		I think the 'detail' (note) errors in particular have the wrong format. Not sure about the way we display 'no line number information' either
Lexer:
	- Combine ignored symbols into a single symbol if they aren't used in the parser @lexer

	- Add the ability to have case-insensitive regexes @lexer @done

	- Add repeats with lower and upper bounds (2 or more x style repeats) @lexer

	- Add support for modifying the NDFA when inheriting from a language (replacing and adding to symbol definitions) @lexer

	- Add support for case-insensitive lexer symbols @lexer @done

	- Make sure |= works in lexer symbol maps @lexer @done

	- If a lexer symbols block is specifically set as case sensitive, then make it case sensitive even in case insensitive contexts @lexer
		Currently we only make sure that case insensitive symbol sets are treated correctly

	- Add a way to override exisiting lexer symbols with new ones, especially when inheriting a language @lexer

	- Reports 'unused symbol' warning when |= is used in an inherited language @lexer @done

	- Check that we check for unused symbols in inherited languages @lexer @done
		- Oops, we report them twice! @done
		- Only check for unused symbols in the language that we're actually compiling @done

	- Make it possible to use (weak) regular expressions 'in line' @lexer

	- Make it possible to suppress reporting unused symbols (for example to create a lexer-only base language) @lexer

	- Make it possible to generate only a lexer
	 
	- Issue with the case sensitivity tests @lexer
		Problem appears to be that when merging if there's no transition for a symbol that's currently merged but similar transitions for all the other symbols then the two sets of symbols are not distinguished.
LALR Parser:
	Parser generator:
		- Fix terminology to be less confusing
			LR items are easily confused with symbols in a production. The problem is made worse by references to symbols in the DFA.

		- Work out how to do LR(k) lookaheads
			One way might be to check if conflicts can be resolved this way and automatically generate guards.

		- Add operator precedence

		- Add support for diverts and guards in can_reduce

		- Add error recovery

	Misc:

		- Assignment operator for the parser table class
		
		- Look into compressing the LR tables
		
		- Add 'reduce now' symbol
			Symbol that causes reduction regardless of lookahead. This is useful when mixing multiple languages, as it can act as a separator to specify where a block in a different language can end and the original language can resume.

			Need to actually support child languages for this to work, though.

		- Detect conflicts that can be resolved by using a LR(1) parser
			These are reduce/reduce conflicts where the two symbols always end up in different states. The weakreduce operation can be used on these to successfully match the language.

			In any state with both nonterminals, the grammar is LR(1) if the conflicted symbol is only used in the follow set of one of them.

			A conflict where the following symbol causes a further reduction can be resolved in a similar way provided that the conflicted symbol causes a further reduction for both nonterminals and that symbol is distinguished in a similar way. I think the conflict cannot be resolved if one of the nonterminals has a shift action in this situation. (That is, unless the follow set for the found state already distinguishes the two symbols). Hm, this will produce a further reduce/reduce conflict, which won't be a problem if we can already resolve it with a weak reduce, so the trick is just to resolve the conflict in the new state first.

			Make this an option passed in on the command line?

Language generation:
	New languages:
		- XML

		- Binary

		- Write the tables in tameparse format

	C++ generator:
		- Deal with items that are identical apart from the guards (will produce a compilation error at the moment)

		- Functions to create parsers for each start symbol

		- The root language node ends up being called epsilon
			Though this symbol is never generatedâ€¦
			
Error reporting:
	- Improve the way reduce/reduce conflicts are reported

	- If a syntax error occurs at the end of the file, we don't report its position

	- Report bad regular expressions @lexer

	- Make it possible to disable errors on conflicting guards

	- Way to suppress shift/reduce conflicts, for example when dealing with the else ambiguity
		Disabling specific conflicts is better than disabling the lot

	- Improve the way errors are reported when an EBNF item (eg identifier*) causes a problem
		Currently if the error happens in a generated rule we report the first usage which is no good

Testing:
	- report the line of the error when the match_from_file style is in use @done
	
	- call tameparse with the --run-tests option for all of the examples @done

	- write tests for the Ansi C language @testing

	- write tests for the Pascal language @done

	- write tests for the parser definition language @testing

	- write tests for the C99 language (once it's done) @testing

	- Stop from running tests if any errors are detected while generating the parser

Examples:
	- Finish the C99 language

	- Write more tests for Pascal
Report statistics:
	- Number of states @done
	
	- Number of rules & nonterminals

	- DFA size @done

	- Parser table sizes @done

	- Number of weak reductions
