# Branching

This repository uses named branches for work on individual features, rather than
cloning to isolate changes. Here are the rules I've been following:

 * Major features are developed on named branches
 * Bug fixes can go on any branch (but if you aren't working directly on a feature they
   should go on the small bugs branch)
 * Once a feature is working, it should be merged into the stable-ish branch
 * The merge messages for the stable-ish branch should be suitable to put the
   ChangeLog file.
 * In general, merges are either to or from the Stable-ish branch.

The stable-ish branch should thus contain working builds of TameParse. Failing that,
the branches for individual platforms can be used to find the last build that was
known to work on that platform. This is convenient because it makes it easy to find
a working build at any time.

The feature branches are useful for two reasons: firstly, they facilitate working
together; it's possible to push changes frequently without needing to merge in
other partially implemented features. Secondly, it's easy to look at the history
for a feature branch to see how that feature evolved (with the possible exception
of bug fixes to that feature, depending on how development has gone).
